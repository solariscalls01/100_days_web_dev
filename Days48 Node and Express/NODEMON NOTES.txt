nodeman package is useful for autostarting the server everytime something changes.
ideally it's installed via:
npm install nodemon --save-dev

In order to get this to work properly, need to make an addition to the package.json in the "Script" section.
Looking at the script, we have a "start": "nodemon app.js"

then when we are in the terminal, all we need to do to run it is "npm start" as it will run that specfic script.
